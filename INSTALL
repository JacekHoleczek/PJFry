Installing libpjfry version 1.0.0

On Unix/Linux and similar systems, you can simply type

./configure [--prefix=/path] [--with-mcc-path=/path/mcc]
make
make install

Use 'make check' to compile a simple example of library use in FORTRAN
(also see note for g77 users)


Configure script will try to find Mathematica installation and mcc tool.
You can turn it off by setting --with-mcc-path=no
or give full path to apropriate mcc tool --with-mcc-path=/path/mcc


REMARK for g77 users:
Current FORTRAN interface follows GNU calling conventions for COMPLEX type.

To work with g77 this library needs to be compiled with FFLAGS='-fno-f2c'
(also library for scalar integrals)

Alternatively you can replace FORTRAN wrapper functions in pjfry.h and pjfry.cpp with subroutines.
e.g. "pj_complex pa0_(double *m1, int *ep)" -> "void pa0_(pj_complex *rslt, double *m1, int *ep)"
